Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
String streams are required. 
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
P.s: it would be cool if you won’t use loops.

Example: «  hello    world!  » -> «world! hello»
